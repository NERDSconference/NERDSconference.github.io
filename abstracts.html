        <p class="abstrl">I will present work in which we compute the higher-form symmetries and anomalies for 3d QFTs constructed in M-theory. I will review higher-form symmetries and their anomalies, and discuss the general "Symmetry Field Theory" construction that encodes these features in a 4d topological field theory associated to the 3d QFT.</p>

        <p class="abstrl">A famous instance of the unreasonable effectiveness of the natural sciences in mathematics is the use of topological string partition functions and mirror symmetry to solve the classical problem of counting holomorphic curves inside complex manifolds. 

By performing this (now quite old) computation to a high degree at genus 0 for a number of multiparameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, it becomes apparent that very often there is a Coxeter group action on the homology classes of curves, under which the counts of curves within each class is invariant. In very many, but not all, examples this symmetry group is of infinite order.

In this talk I explain these above statements and discuss the origins of this Coxeter symmetry. I go on to speculate that this novel infinite symmetry group can be used to address open problems in computing higher genus topological string partition functions on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

In keeping with my traditional optimistic approach to NERDS, I describe the higher genus computation for which I have code that doesn't currently work, because of my failures both as a mathematician and as a man.</p>
