    <p class="abstrl">In 2015, Beem, Lemos, Liendo, Peelaers, Rastelli and van Rees found a remarkable correspondence between SCFTs in 4d with N ≥ 2 and Vertex Algebras. The vertex algebras associated to theories of Class S are of particular interest — as they exhibit rich algebraic structures arising from the requirement of generalised S-duality. Indeed, it was shown by Beem, Peelaers, Rastelli and van Rees that one may construct all such vertex algebras starting from the vertex algebra of the three punctured sphere, i.e. the trinion vertex algebra. In 2018, Arakawa found an explicit construction of these vertex algebras for the genus zero case. I shall discuss the extension of Arakawa’s construction to the twisted puncture setting.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">I will introduce the fascinating topic of chiral rings and their relation to topological data latent in the definition of an N = 2 four dimensional superconformal field theory. Of prime importance is our ability to compute chiral rings using spectral sequences. This computational tool makes evident the mathematical nature of certain chiral rings, in particular the Hall-Littlewood Chiral Ring, an object we will discuss at length.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">Worldsheet approaches to massless scattering give compact formulae for tree level S-matrices and loop integrands. At tree level, these are in the form of integrals over the moduli space of the marked Riemann sphere, localised on a set of constraints called the scattering equations. I will briefly review the d-dimensional framework (CHY) and focus on dimension-specific formulations in four and six dimensions that rely on spinor helicity and allow for the introduction of fermions and supersymmetry. I will discuss how these formulae can be used to derive scattering amplitudes involving massive particles.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">The elliptic genus for the worldvolume theory of a D4-brane wrapping a Calabi-Yau can be decomposed into a product of a generalised Theta function and a certain vector valued modular form. The microstate indices for the D4-D2-D0 states are encapsulated solely by the latter form’s coefficients. These numbers in turn relate to the geometry of the Calabi-Yau. Such forms are completely determined by their polar coefficients- which physically correspond to states violating cosmic censorship- through the Rademacher expansion. In this talk we discuss some general aspects of the theory of such forms, including their asymptotics and the details and subtleties of this expansion. We relate these notions to geometrical questions concerning the celebrated manifold AESZ34.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">Attractor mechanism for N = 2, d = 4 SUGRA gives an interesting example of a deep interplay of physics, geometry and number theory. First, I will review attractor mechanism using mainly a somewhat novel D3-brane point of view. I will then use the mechanism to derive an interesting series expansion for the entropy of the black hole. This expansion has a remarkable similarity to modular form asymptotics, and indeed it turns out that at least in some cases, the microstates can be counted by coefficients of a modular form. The coefficients in this modular form are related to topological quantities of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their divisor moduli spaces. Intriguingly, knowing this modular form allows us to easily get conjectural answers to some very complicated geometric questions. Time permitting, I will finish with some philosophical and experimentally-minded remarks.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">The trinion theories T<sub>N</sub> are a very well-studied class of field theories with eight supercharges. In 5d they are SCFTs realised as M-theory compactifications on <nobr>C<sup>3</sup>/Z<sub>N</sub> x Z<sub>N</sub></nobr>. We apply to them a multitude of recently developed approaches to studying 5d SCFTs and their IR gauge theory descriptions, reviewing them in the process. Thereby we provide a complete picture of the theories both on the Coulomb branch and Higgs branch.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">In this talk I will consider theories obtained from M-theory compactification on <nobr>X × S<sup>1</sup></nobr>, with X an isolated Calabi-Yau threefold and finite size S<sup>1</sup>. The Seiberg-Witten geometry of the resulting KK theories can be obtained using mirror symmetry (for toric X). This should, in principle, be enough to determine the prepotential and the BPS spectrum. I will focus on the KK theories obtained from the E<sub>0</sub> and E<sub>1</sub> five-dimensional SCFTs, considering certain ’geometric engineering limits’ as well.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">In this talk I will show how to derive the structure of the Higgs branch of a 5d SCFT or gauge theory, given by a generalized toric diagram (GTD), in terms of an edge coloring. This is motivated by a tropical curve decomposition of the dual <nobr>(p, q)</nobr> 5-brane web. The coloring provides a decomposition of the generalized toric polygon into the Minkowski sum of sub-polygons, from which we compute the magnetic quiver. Furthermore, we can determine from identifications of partial resolutions, the symplectic leaves, and thereby the entire structure of the 5d Higgs branch.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">Recent years have seen a big progress in the understanding of quantum field theories defined in curved backgrounds. In particular, in the presence of supersymmetry it has been possible to derive many exact results for large classes of background manifolds. In the talk I will consider a simple N=1 quantum field theory defined on a manifold diffeomorphic to S<sup>1</sup> x S<sup>3</sup>, review some known results derived through the technique of dimensional reduction, and explain how they extend to the more general case where the 3-sphere is twisted over the circle. This particular background is relevant in the contest of holography as it corresponds to the boundary of supersymmetric black holes in five-dimensional Anti de Sitter space, with the twisting of the sphere corresponding to rotation parameters. The field theory computations are eventually aimed to tackle the problem of black hole microstate counting.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">The partition function of 3 dimensional gravity has been an object of interest for quite some time now. However, the numerous attempts on solving it have yielded confusing results: its holographic dual appears to have negative-norm states, which we will revisit and then sketch some of the solutions that have been proposed within the last decade (including very exciting recent findings!). Furthermore, in 3 dimensions we can add higher spin currents to the theory of gravity in an interesting way, and check with its holographic duals (W<sub>N</sub> CFTs) what happens, using bootstrap techniques: not only do these results have an interest on their own from both sides of the duality, but they can also help us understand better the simpler case of ”normal” gravity and Virasoro CFTs.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">In this talk I will begin reviewing heterotic G2 systems, that is: compactifications of the heterotic string on a manifold with G2 structure preserving N = 1 SUSY in 3 dimensions. I will then discuss the construction of an explicit family of examples of these systems.</p>

    <h1 class="speakertitler"><a class="linktoabstract" name="dewi"> DEWI </a> <br><span class="titletalk">Horizon Molecules in Causal Set Theory</span></h1>
    <p class="abstrr">We propose a new definition of “horizon molecules” in Causal Set Theory following pioneering work by Dou and Sorkin. The new concept applies for any causal horizon and its intersection with any spacelike hypersurface. In the continuum limit, as the discreteness scale tends to zero, the leading behaviour of the expected number of horizon molecules is shown to be the area of the horizon in discreteness units, up to a dimension dependent factor of order one. We also determine the first order corrections to the continuum value, and show how such corrections can be exploited to obtain further geometrical information about the horizon and the spacelike hypersurface from the causal set.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">I will describe the recent progress on the application of modular bootstrap, in the form of modular linear differential equations, to the classification problem of three-character CFT (based on arXiv:2002.01949). The primary focus will be on discovering and utilising the ”quasi-character” solutions, as well as the novel coset construction of arXiv:1602.01022.</p>

    <h1 class="speakertitler"><a class="linktoabstract" name="atul"> ATUL </a> <br><span class="titletalk">Celestialology</span></h1>
    <p class="abstrr">Celestial conformal field theory is a budding field delving into a new proposal for flat holography: Mellin transformed 4d scattering amplitudes might secretly be the correlators of some 2d CFT living on the sky. After giving a brief introduction to the idea, I will describe ongoing work in reconstructing bulk physics from the conjectured operator algebra of this boundary CFT. In particular, we will see how some standard footprints of locality in gluon amplitudes can emerge purely as byproducts of the OPE combined with conjectured symmetries of this CFT.</p>
