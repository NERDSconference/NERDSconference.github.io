        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Holographically describing physics in asymptotically flat space-times has been a long-standing program, with celestial and Carrollian holography being the modern manifestation. Many problems arise when considering the boundary of generic asymptotically flat space-times, such as gravitational radiation creating a non-conserved stress tensor or the singular point at spatial infinity, causing problems in identifying initial and final state symmetries in scattering processes. Using various twistorial methods, we try to understand these problems from a geometric perspective by first considering fields on twistor space and mapping them to the asymptotic boundary. </p>

        <p class="abstrl">3d SCFTs compactified on a Rieman surface are holograhically dual to black holes in AdS4. In particular, the field theory free energy reproduces the black hole entropy, offering a microstate interpretation for the latter. Moreover in order to compute the free energy, one needs to localize the path integral. In the process, the field theory gets reformulated as a matrix model whose eigenvalues become dense in the large N limit. Specifically the distribution of these eigenvalues is a piece-wise linear function, and has a dual geometric interpretation... The type of SCFTs of interest are N=2 Chern-Simons-matter theories, which can be geometrically engineered from string theory. In this talk, I will review the construction of these models as D2 branes wordvolume theories. Then, I will show how to localize them and obtain their eigenvalue distribution at large N.</p>

        <p class="abstrl">A BRST formulation of pure d=4, N=1 conformal supergravity is developed to characterize superconformal anomalies of matter theories whose (super)currents are coupled to the background gauge fields of conformal supergravity. The BRST transformations of the ghosts are encoded in the d=4, N=1 conformal Lie superalgebra and nilpotency of the BRST operator on the ghosts determines its action on the gauge fields. Following Stora and Zumino, generalized-connections — the sum of ghost and gauge fields — are introduced: a unique superconformal invariant polynomial cubic in the generalized curvatures is determined and its associated Chern-Simons generalized-form is the BRST cocycle which captures the (type a) superconformal anomaly.</p>

Down the rabbit hole, you will discover how the continuously distributed eigenvalues of the matrix model arising from 3d SCFTs naturally emerge as specific geometric quantities associated to the M-theory circle and its embedding in the internal space.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">AdS/CFT in three dimensions is often examined through the lens of ensemble-averaged partition functions, where the average is performed over some moduli space of conformal field theories. These theories live on the boundary of an AdS spacetime. Euclidean wormholes are a key playground for examining these ideas because they allow us to compute higher moments of these ensemble averages. Indeed, a two-boundary wormhole can be thought of as computing the two-point function of the partition functions of the CFTs living on its boundaries. In this talk, we derive new solutions to Einstein's equations in three dimensions, exact wormholes with propagating scalar fields, and discuss their interpretation in terms of CFT averages. We also show they imply a precise relation between evolution in CFT moduli space and the geometric moduli space of the boundaries, and discuss ongoing efforts to generalize these results.</p>

        <p class="abstrl">Preceding Lea’s presentation, I will go over some of the theory behind generalised symmetries and relate it to the study of QFTs and quantum matter systems in the far IR. More specifically, I will allude to how one can generalise Landau’s programme of classifying phases of a given gapped theory in the IR beyond group symmetries to also include non-invertible (categorical) symmetries. </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">String theory compactifications are usually performed on manifolds with specific geometric structures (a Riemannian metric, an almost complex structure, Killing vectors...). The consequence is a symmetry enhancement, and the worldsheet theory is now left invariant by a new set of non-linear transformations called W-symmetries. Can we use W-symmetries to also describe the geometric structures of an additional gauge bundle, a blessing and a curse for heterotic string theory? As I will show,  we need to go quantum to answer the question!</p>

        <p class="abstrl">Modern computational methods to construct scattering amplitudes exploit symmetries, on-shell kinematics and factorization to avoid the cumbersome task of computing Feynman diagrams. Most of these techniques are fine when dealing with scattering around the vacuum, whilst much less is known for scattering about strong backgrounds. In this talk, I'll show how to compute 2-point amplitudes in the presence of a self-dual dyon background or on self-dual Taub-NUT space-time, and sketch how twistor theory can be used to construct n-point MHV amplitudes around the same backgrounds.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Taking extrema of the six-dimensional heterotic superpotential gives the so-called F-term constraints of the Hull-Strominger system. Starting at a solution, one can consider "off-shell" fluctuations of the structure in the superpotential. This gives rise to a theory with similar features to Kodaira-Spencer gravity. A natural next step is then to quantise this theory. I will discuss the computation of the one-loop partition function and find it can be expressed as a product of holomorphic Ray-Singer torsions. Finally, I will discuss its potential metric anomaly.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Following on Dan’s presentation, I will explain how to characterize gapped phases in 2d using the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), both for vanilla symmetries and for the so-called categorical symmetries. The SymTFT is a 3d topological theory associated to a 2d theory, which can be recovered as its interval compactification in the extra dimension, and it has two boundaries, one encoding the symmetries and one the dynamics of the 2d theory. In the approach I will use, both boundaries are topological. It turns out that this set-up not only provides a general framework to classify gapped phases in 2d, but also gives concrete tools to compute a lot of information on the phases. </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Given the growing interest in nonlocal CFTs, we present the study of the long-range Ising model (LRI) that includes interactions over an infinite distance. The LRI is a family of fixed points, parametrized by a real variable that can be varied within a certain range. Each endpoint allows the theory to be reached from a weakly coupled flow. This naturally leads to an interesting epsilon-expansion of the CFT data. After reviewing the two possible descriptions of the LRI, we briefly comment on how to bootstrap this system, both analytically and numerically. We then show how to access an infinite amount of 2d CFT data at once using the Lorentzian inversion formula up to three loops. </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">The definition of mass and energy density in general relativity has proven to
be quite tricky: to be more specific, there is no known meaningful notion of
a local gravitational energy tensor. It is however important to try to define
some sort of quasi-local energy: a promising perspective is offered by the
Covariant Phase Space formalism developed by Iyer, Lee, Wald, and Zoupas. In particular, this formalism provides us with an expression for the
Hamiltonian that can be employed to compute the energy of finite regions of
space-time for gravitational theories.
The aim of my work is to use this formalism to compute the Hamiltonian
for different theories.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Argyres-Douglas theories are strongly coupled 4d N=2 superconformal field theories characterised by fractional Coulomb branch scaling dimensions. A well-established organisational principle for these SCFTs is to characterise them by the data defining a wild Hitchin system on a Riemann surface. The dictionary between Hitchin system data and various features of the corresponding SCFT has been studied extensively, but the overall structure of the resulting space of SCFTs still appears quite complicated. In this talk, I will describe my research on the systematic delineation of a variety of simplifications that arise within this class of constructions due to several large classes of isomorphisms between SCFTs associated with inequivalent Hitchin system data (and their exactly marginal gaugings).</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">The AdS/CFT correspondence is one of the most important conceptual developments in theoretical physics in the last 30 years. The Hawking-Page phase transition is a good example of how the correspondence consistently reproduces known results in alternative ways while also providing new insights into physics. Originally discovered in 1983, the phase transition now also has an interesting interpretation on the field theory side when studied in the context of the correspondence.
By introducing certain AdS-specific surface terms as counterterms the gravitational action of asymptotically AdS spacetimes can be regulated. This counterterm approach significantly simplifies the calculations for the phase transition and can also be used to recover the Brown-Henneaux central charge from AdS_3 as well as the Weyl anomaly, providing further evidence for the consistency of the conjecture. Finally, it allows for the definition of a quasilocal stress-energy tensor on the boundary AdS with which masses of asymptotically AdS spacetimes can be calculated. Interestingly, this leads to a non-zero mass for global AdS which can be interpreted on the field theory side.</p>
