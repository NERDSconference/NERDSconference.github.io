    <p class="abstrl">Weinberg's soft theorems for gluon and graviton scattering in our 4d universe look eerily like the Ward identities of a 2d CFT living on the sky. The latter is dubbed a "celestial CFT" and is conjectured to be the holographic dual of flat space physics. I will review these facts and discuss how further soft theorems give rise to infinitely many extra global symmetries of this 2d CFT on top of the usual Virasoro algebra. Like a true Christie, the search for their origins brings us to a culprit that would hardly be suspected at first: twistor theory!

    <p class="abstrr">I will introduce new ambitwistor-string models for theories with massive particles. These lead to formulae for amplitudes that rely on a massive version of the scattering equations. A twistorial model in four dimensions produces amplitudes for the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM and gives an off-shell extension of previously known massless models, thus allowing the treatment of loop insertions in twistorial amplitude formulae for supersymmetric theories in 4d.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">In this talk I will explain how one may fight back against the tyranny of Peter Higgs and his mechanism in the setting of 4D N=2 SCFTs. With knowledge of the IR theory, one may recover certain protected sectors of the UV theory using the Free-Field Realisation of Beem, Meneghelli and Rastelli.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">In 2013, Beem and his collaborators found a remarkable correspondence between 4d N=2 superconformal field theories and 2d vertex operator algebras (VOA). One of the manifestations of this correspondence is the relation between the (Schur limit of the) superconformal index and the vacuum character of the corresponding VOA. Through the extensive work on 2d CFTs (inherently related to 2d VOAs), one knows a lot about their character and in particular about their modular properties. The correspondence then implies the existence of modularity in the Schur index. In this talk, I will discuss the modular properties of the Schur index of 4d N=2 SCFTs, focusing on an important class of theories known as Class S theories, as well as the 4d N=4 SYM with gauge group SU(M). As we will see, modular forms do not suffice to describe these indices and one has to expand to the notion of ``quasi-modularity”.

    <p class="abstrl">Attractor equations in d=4, N=2 supergravity theories are differential equations which fix the continuous moduli of ½-BPS black hole solutions as functions of the black hole charges. Particularly interesting examples of these supergravities are provided by Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II string theories, where the continuous moduli are the geometric moduli, and the attractor mechanism can be viewed as fixing the integral geometry of the black hole. We develop a method for solving the attractor equations for CYs with large complex structure. This allows us to write a surprisingly simple formula for the fully instanton-corrected black hole entropy. The geometric invariants appearing in this formula give a strong hint of microstate contributions, which motivates deeper study of some related geometries.

    <p class="abstrl">I will describe how the geometry of the Higgs branch of 5d SCFTs is transformed under movement along the extended Coulomb branch. By working directly with the magnetic quiver, I will demonstrate a correspondence between Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations in 3d and 5d mass deformations. When the Higgs branch has multiple cones and the mirror map is not globally well-defined, we are able to utilize this correspondence to establish a local version of mirror symmetry.

    <p class="abstrr">In this talk I will review some aspects of the Seiberg-Witten description of the Coulomb branch of rank-one 4d N=2 supersymmetric QFTs, emphasizing certain links with the theory of rational elliptic surfaces. The configurations of Kodaira fibers of such surfaces have been classified by Persson and Miranda and serve as a tool for understanding RG flows and the (global) flavour symmetry. Additionally, many of these surfaces have interesting modular properties which can be used to find the spectrum of light particles at strong coupling and the associated BPS quivers.

    <p class="abstrl">Among the phenomena that can characterize the low energy dynamics of a 4d N=1 SQFT, infra-red dualities play a central role, and their study can provide numerous insights on the strongly-coupled regime of a theory. Here I will present some techniques to derive dualities for USp(2N) quiver gauge theories, essentially based on the idea of obtaining new conjectures by applying in an iterative way other more elementary Seiberg-like dualities, which we assume as fundamental. The central tool we use in our derivation is the supersymmetric index, which, for 4d N=1 SQFTs, can be written as an elliptic hypergeometrical integral. In this way physical dualities translate into mathematical identities between those kinds of integrals, providing a nice interplay between the two areas of research.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">T-duality, in String Theory, is usually associated with a very mild setup: a circle compactification. However, it is possible to study a generalized T-duality procedure that allows us to say non-trivial things about dualities between more challenging scenarios. Interesting things happen in combination with additional symmetries on the worldsheet and G-structures. To spice things up, we focus on Heterotic String Theory and we add a gauge bundle to the equation.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">The presence of impurities and defects in real systems requires the extension of the standard apparatus of universality and RG. My research analyses the effect of the introduction of a quenched (i.e. time-independent) disorder in the critical O(2) vector model. How to understand whether the disorder modifies the critical behavior of the pure system, that is a CFT? The so-called Harris criterion allows for the qualitative prediction of the pure fixed point stability against disorder. By using the Replica Trick, one obtains a set of (n) identical independent copies of the initial system, each of them coupled to the same disorder. However, the Path Integral in the impurities leads to an interaction term between the replicas. I study the evolution of the related coupling with the tools of Conformal Perturbation Theory: knowing the pure theory CFT data (the correlators), one can deduce the properties of the random system by studying the RG flow. I focus on the random temperature perturbation, namely the insertion of the O(2) singlet with a random coupling. My strategy is to perform the analysis in d=4-ε and then attempt the computation directly in d=3, when the starting point is a strongly interacting CFT, investigated with numerical conformal bootstrap techniques. Then, I present the new interesting case of a random perturbation associated with the lowest-dimension charge-2 scalar of the O(2) model. One expects to find a new IR fixed point since this operator should be relevant in d=3 from conformal bootstrap studies. Moreover, contrary to the random temperature case, this perturbation is charged under the O(2) group: will it induce a global symmetry breaking?</p>

    <p class="abstrr">I will give an overview of the spindle solutions that have been considered so far in the context of consistent truncations of D=10,11 supergravities, highlighting the main features of each case. In particular, I will discuss the two possible “twists” that allow for supersymmetry to be preserved when compactifying a theory on a spindle, explaining their relation to the more standard topological twist. Finally, I will focus on the case of 4d minimal gauged supergravity, where a UV completion of the near-horizon spindle solutions is known: the Plebanski-Demianski accelerating black holes.</p>

    <p class="abstrl">In this talk I wish to introduce the audience to higher-form symmetries (HFS) and what one can do with them. Specifically, I will cover: HFS in generality, how they appear in holography, what they have to do with confinement, and their mixed anomalies with ordinary symmetries. I will focus on 4d N=1 SU(N) SYM and derive its 1-form symmetry, confinement properties and a mixed anomaly that is related to chiral symmetry breaking.</p>

    <p class="abstrr">In "ordinary" string theory, D-branes can be either described from a microscopic point of view, or as extended solutions of the corresponding low-energy supergravity. In this talk, I try to address some aspects of analogous low-energy solutions in non-supersymmetric string theories. I start recalling the construction of non-supersymmetric, non-tachyonic string theories and focusing on the resulting low-energy theory. Then, I specialize the equations of motion to a brane geometry and discuss their properties. In the absence of supersymmetry, the most striking feature of these solutions is arguably the presence of a spontaneously compactified radial direction, which replaces the usual asymptotically flat structure far away from the brane.
