        <p class="abstrl">I will present work in which we compute the higher-form symmetries and anomalies for 3d QFTs constructed in M-theory. I will review higher-form symmetries and their anomalies, and discuss the general "Symmetry Field Theory" construction that encodes these features in a 4d topological field theory associated to the 3d QFT.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">A famous instance of the unreasonable effectiveness of the natural sciences in mathematics is the use of topological string partition functions and mirror symmetry to solve the classical problem of counting holomorphic curves inside complex manifolds. 

By performing this (now quite old) computation to a high degree at genus 0 for a number of multiparameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, it becomes apparent that very often there is a Coxeter group action on the homology classes of curves, under which the counts of curves within each class is invariant. In very many, but not all, examples this symmetry group is of infinite order.

In this talk I explain these above statements and discuss the origins of this Coxeter symmetry. I go on to speculate that this novel infinite symmetry group can be used to address open problems in computing higher genus topological string partition functions on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

In keeping with my traditional optimistic approach to NERDS, I describe the higher genus computation for which I have code that doesn't currently work, because of my failures both as a mathematician and as a man.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">BPS quivers are objects that famously encode the spectrum of BPS particles on the Coulomb branch of 4d N=2 theories. I this talk, I will review the concept of Galois covers, which is a functor between quivers of seemingly different theories. I will give a geometric interpretation for Galois covers using local mirror symmetry and Seiberg-Witten geometry. This eventually simplifies the computation of BPS spectra for more complex theories.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">In this talk, I will first review the positivity bounds method. Namely, how some constraints on an EFT coefficients can be derived from physical assumptions (unitarity, locality, causality, and Lorentz invariance) on its unknown UV-completion. An EFT parameter space is typically huge and it proves useful to have some theoretical constraints to narrow it down. In the second part of the talk, I will turn to some EFT massive vector models, the Generalized Proca and the Proca Nuevo, and present how their parameter space is restricted by the positivity constraints. Even though these two models are inequivalent, some interesting analogies arise in their positivity bounds. </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Conformal Field Theories are so popular because it is possible to use their large set of symmetries to explicitly compute many exact results. However, this miracolous feature seems to disappear once we turn on a finite temperature and the symmetry group is shattered. In the talk I will discuss how to handle the remnants of this group not only to recover a general structure for a CFT at finite temperature, but also to compute exact results. </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">In this talk I will try to give an overview of the numerous results so far achieved concerning the holographic dual of various SCFTs extremisation principles. The key point that will guide us throughout theories and dimensions is to consider off-shell geometries which will become actual supergravity solutions upon extremising a certain function over the possible R-symmetry vectors. Such an approach allows us to compute entropies, central charges, R-charges, etc. without the need of going through the hassle of solving the supergravity EoM, hence proving the validity of the AdS/CFT dictionary in many concrete examples for which we do not have full control of the supergravity side of the duality. Finally, I will try to explain briefly how my recent work fits into this general picture (rejoice, as there will be spindles!) and point out some possible future extensions.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">In the context of AdS/CFT, conformal correlators are mapped to on-shell scattering amplitudes in AdS. All 4-pt tree-level correlators of arbitrary KK modes in all maximally SCFTs have been successfully computed. Interestingly, even a SCFT preserving only 8 supercharges can still admit a weakly coupled holographic dual, allowing for the study of gauge theories in AdS. In this talk we will see how to bootstrap tree-level n-pt amplitudes of AdS super gluons and introduce vertex identities to solve the integrals over AdS "without really trying". </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">The discovery of BCFW recursion relations brought simplifications to tree-level scattering amplitudes in gauge theories, but, in the process, we lose manifest locality by introducing spurious poles. The positive geometry program aims to construct geometric objects that avoid these issues while providing a geometric description of BCFW. An amplituhedron is a geometric object which lives in a Grassmannian from which the scattering amplitude is reproduced by integrating a volume form. The tree amplituhedron, along with its volume form, is conjectured to be a positive geometry that describes tree-level amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM. Additionally, momentum twistors are introduced as the most natural kinematic variables to construct invariant expressions in planar N=4 SYM.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">Observables in QFT are traditionally computed by summing a (fairly large) number of Feynman diagrams. For amplitudes, there are by now various techniques to avoid this redundant and inefficient formalism, and some of these methods can also be applied to form factors, i.e. to matrix elements of local operators between the vacuum and an on-shell state. Sadly, most of these approaches break down once we try to explore observables around non-trivial backgrounds. Twistor theory is a powerful approach to tackle this problem, as long as one considers self-dual radiative backgrounds. In this talk, I'll review the relevant twistor theory needed to describe gauge theories, and describe how one can compute amplitudes and form factors around these backgrounds. Time permitting, I'll give a glimpse of the extension of these ideas to gravity, as well as to non-radiative backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="abstrl">Celestial CFTs have been an active topic of research in the last few years, with many researchers from different backgrounds getting involved in the subject. In this talk, we will introduce Celestial CFTs from scratch, and then focus on a particular problem: how can we extract information on the CCFT spectrum from the scattering of massless particles? </p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl"> In the past year, a lot of attention has been given to non-invertible symmetries in dimensions higher than 3. These are characterized by the fact that the associated topological defects obey more general, not group-like fusions. In this talk I will present a prescription for constructing non-invertible symmetries by gauging outer-automorphism 0-form symmetries and apply it to some concrete gauge theory examples.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">The 2d vertex operator algebra (VOA) associated with a 4d N=2 SCFT is a  powerful tool to probe various properties of the SCFT. In particular, there is an intimate relation between certain mathematical objects associated with the VOA and the Higgs branch and the superconformal index of the SCFT. Argyres-Douglas (AD) SCFTs are a famous and vast class of 4d N=2 theories characterised by fractional Coulomb branch dimensions. I will limit myself only to the M-theory (read Hitchin system) construction and consider these theories' usual "class S" treatment.

So far, the VOAs associated with these theories are only known for cases where the global symmetry algebra of these theories is that from a "regular class S puncture." In this talk, I will report an extension in our understanding of the cases where there is a potential enhancement of the global symmetry algebra. We achieved this by realising a non-trivial identification between various Argyres-Douglas theories. This identification is interesting in its own right and enables us to determine the VOAs associated with these theories.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="abstrl">The theories of Class S, obtained by compactifying the spooky 6D N=(2,0) theories on a Riemann surface, have a rich set of observables with intricate mathematical properties arising from dualities. One such observable is the vertex algebra of the theory, first described by Beem-Peelaers-Rastelli, following work by Beem-Lemos-Liendo-Peelaers-Rastelli-van Rees.

These vertex algebras have a formal, mathematical construction due to Arakawa. In this talk, I briefly review Arakawa's construction and the various dualities predicted by physics. Time permitting, I will describe an extension of this work to the setting of twisted class S.</p>
